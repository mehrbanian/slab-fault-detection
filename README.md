# Slab fault etection
Slab is the final product of Foulad Factory in Hormozgan. In the Slab production process, initially, the raw materials are melted in a smelting process to become molten. This operation takes place in 2 electric arc furnaces. Then, the necessary steps for producing the final product are carried out in the crucible furnaces. In the next stage, the molten materials are cast and transformed into the final Slab product. During the quality control phase, defects in Slab are identified and recorded. In this project we proposed an intelligent system to detect fault in slab slab production process.
